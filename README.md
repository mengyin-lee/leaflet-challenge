3. Connects to geojson API using d3 without error (d3.json)
4. Create markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude
5. Create a legend showing the depth and corresponding color
6. Data points scale with magnitude level
7. Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth
8. All data points load in the correct locations
